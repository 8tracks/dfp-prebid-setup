Contributions are welcome. To contribute, [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repo, commit your changes, and [open a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

I will try to be responsive but will likely have limited time to dedicate to bugs and new featuresâ€”your help is appreciated!

## Submitting Issues

**For bugs**, please provide:
* Info on what you expected would happen, and what actually happened
* Your settings from `settings.py`, hiding any sensitive info
* Your Python version (`python --version`)

**For feature requests**, please provide background on how you'd use the feature, and share whether you can contribute the feature yourself :) Note that the scope of this repository is to cover typical use for Prebid.js with DFP, but it will not cover all corner cases.

## Pull Requests

In pull requests:
* Include tests for all new code, and ensure all tests pass
* Confirm that you've successfully run the code against your DFP setup
* Refer to the Github issue the PR is addressing
* Practice good code commenting

## Running Tests

Run `python -m unittest discover`.
